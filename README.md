# SpaceX Machine Learning Prediction
Project background and context
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space
age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon
9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars;
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we
can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost
of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning
models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
